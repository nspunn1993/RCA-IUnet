# RCA-IUnet: Residual cross spatial attention guided inception U-Net model
This repository contains the implementation of the RCA-IUnet model. The model is developed from our paper "RCA-IUnet: A residual cross-spatial attention guided inception U-Net model for tumor segmentation in breast ultrasound imaging".

The model is built with Tensorflow v2.6
